#Features:

## Compiled language:
Go is a compiled language meaning it converts the source code directly into machine readable code using compiler.

It's compilation speed is often faster as compared to languages like c, c++ and Rust.

It's execution speed is faster than java, and other interpreted languages.

## Automatic Memory Allocation:
In Go you don't need to explicitly allocate memory or free memory as you would in languages like C or C++.

## Strongly typed:
In Go, variable types are strictly enforced. This means that once you declare a variable with a specific type, you cannot perform operations on it that are not allowed by that type.
For example, you cannot add string and an integer in strongly typed languages.

## Static typed:
This means that in Go, the type of a variable is determined at compile time, and it is associated with the variable, not the value it holds. Once a variable is declared with a specific type, it cannot change to a different type.

## Garbage collection:
Contains small runtime (binary program) with every compiled output, which acts as garbage collector.
Go uses a garbage collector to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation.
The garbage collector identifies and reclaims memory that is no longer in use by the program, making it available for reuse.
While the garbage collector adds some overhead at runtime, it can simplify the compilation process.
